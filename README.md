# Statistical Analysis, Hypothesis A/B Testing
As a data professional in a data consulting firm, called Automatidata. The current project for our newest client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission.

## Project objectives
Using A/B Testing to analyze the relationship between fare amount and payment type.

In this project, I will practice using statistics to analyze and interpret data. The activity covers fundamental concepts such as descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing. I will be exploring the data provided and conduct A/B and hypothesis testing.

### The purpose ## 
This project is to demostrate knowledge of how to prepare, create, and analyze A/B tests. My A/B test results aim to find ways to generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers.

**Note:** For the purpose of this project, assume that the sample data comes from an experiment in which customers are randomly selected and divided into two groups: 1) customers who are required to pay with credit card, 2) customers who are required to pay with cash.

### The Goal ###
To apply descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing in Python. The goal for this A/B test is to sample data and analyze whether there is a relationship between payment type and fare amount. For example: discover if customers who use credit cards pay higher fare amounts than customers who use cash.
  
### This projects has four parts: ###

**Part 1:** Imports and data loading
* Includes loading packages necessary for hypothesis testing.

**Part 2:** Conduct EDA and hypothesis testing
* Compute descriptive statistics to help in data analyze.

* Forumlate null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis.

**Part 3:** Communicate insights with stakeholders

* What key business insight(s) emerged from the A/B test.

* What are the proposed business recommendations based on the results.
